# Nodal Notebook Documentation

This repository contains the source Markdown files for [Nodal Notebook's documentation website](https://nodal-notebook.aria-network.com).

## Technology Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a fast, simple, and beautiful static site generator tailored for project documentation.
- **Theme**: The site employs the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for MkDocs, which provides a responsive and modern design.
